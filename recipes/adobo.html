        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Here's a recipe for chicken adobo I found at
            https://www.skinnytaste.com/filipino-adobo-chicken/.
            I always liked chicken adobo so I figured I might as well
            review how to cook it.
         </p>
         <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 chicken drumsticks, on the bone, skin removed</li>
                <li>1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce, use gluten-free soy sauce for GF and coconut aminos for Paleo</li>
                <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 small head of garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>6 ground peppercorns</li>
                <li>4 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 jalapeño, chopped (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        
         <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate chicken in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, jalapeño and pepper, for at least an hour (overnight is ideal).</li>
                <li>Put chicken, 1/2 cup water, bay leaves and marinade into a deep nonstick skillet and cook on medium-low heat. Cover and cook until the meat is tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the cover and cook an additional 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces.</li>
                <li>Discard bay leaves and serve over rice if you wish.</li>
            </ol>
        
        <p>Bon Appetit!</p>
